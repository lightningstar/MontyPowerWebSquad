    <h3>Create Progress Monitors</h3>
    <p>
    If you are put in charge of a work project you need to do more than just set things in motion and check in at the end. It's important to monitor the progress of the project so you will know if adjustments need to be made to get it moving back in the right direction. To effectively monitor project progress, you must understand its objective as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the personnel involved.

    <h3>Create Group Chats</h3>
    <p> 
    With Group Chat functionality, teams can efficiently share information, ideas, and decisions as a group. The messages posted to group chat rooms (discussion forums) persist so that people from different locations and departments can participate, even when they are not all online at the same time. Group Chat offers a user interface that helps users create chat rooms to organize themselves into virtual teams. Chat room members can participate in many concurrent discussions, thereby helping to remove communication barriers and improve information distribution across teams and the organization.

    <h3>Creating Team Calanders</h3>
    <p>
        When you are in an Exchange environment, rather than to create an additional Team Calendar, consider sharing your Calendar with your team mates instead. By creating a Calendar group for your team, you can quickly select them all and display them in the Overlay View to get a combined overview of the activities and availability of the entire team. An added benefit of using shared calendars is helping a busy organization balance out the work. At a startup, each employee typically wears numerous hats. With a shared calendar, managers get a better idea of employees' current obligations and availability for new projects. They can optimally plan events and tasks with that in mind. Open schedules are also advantageous for scheduling group meetings and determining when most people are free.
