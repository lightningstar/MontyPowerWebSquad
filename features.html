    <h5>Create Progress Monitors</h5>
    <p>
    If you are put in charge of a work project you need to do more than just set things in motion and check in at the end. It's important to monitor the progress of the project so you will know if adjustments need to be made to get it moving back in the right direction. To effectively monitor project progress, you must understand its objective as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the personnel involved.
