    <p>
    If you are put in charge of a work project you need to do more than just set things in motion and check in at the end. It's important to monitor the progress of the project so you will know if adjustments need to be made to get it moving back in the right direction. To effectively monitor project progress, you must understand its objective as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the personnel involved.

    <h3>Create Group Chats</h3>
    <p> 
    With Group Chat functionality, teams can efficiently share information, ideas, and decisions as a group. The messages posted to group chat rooms (discussion forums) persist so that people from different locations and departments can participate, even when they are not all online at the same time. Group Chat offers a user interface that helps users create chat rooms to organize themselves into virtual teams. Chat room members can participate in many concurrent discussions, thereby helping to remove communication barriers and improve information distribution across teams and the organization.
